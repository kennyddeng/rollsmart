- wheel diameter is 20cm (0.2m)
- testing debounce times
- calc debounce time based on max speed
    - max speed = 10 km/h ~= 2.77 m/s
    - wheel circumference = pi * dia = 3.14 * 0.2 = 0.628 m
    - max rev/s = max speed/wheel circumference = 2.77 m/s / 0.628 m ~= 4.41 rev/s
    - therefore, debounce time should be 1 / max rev/s = 1 / 4.41 rev/s ~= 0.226 s

- load cell values keep increasing for some reason
    - value will change drastically upon load applied, but will not return to original value
        - ex. 1000 base, push sensor with hand value goes to 100000, take hand off value goes down to 20000 (not base of 1000)

- strain gauge no bend value ~1300
- getting intermittent misses, value is ~900 when that happens and sensor wont react to changes
